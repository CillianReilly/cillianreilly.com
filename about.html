	<h1>About</h1>
	
	<p>Learning and education are a lifelong pursuit.
	<br>
	I enjoy programming as a craft, rather than simply using it as a means to an end. I prefer array programming languages, in particular kdb+/q.
	<br>
	My favourite maths theorem is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed-point_theorem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brouwer's fixed-point theorem</a>. Trying to mix a beverage completely is hapless, unless you are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed-point_theorem#Illustrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Bond</a>.
	<br>
	I keep my personal code at <a href="https://github.com/cillianreilly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com/cillianreilly.com</a>. Highlights include an automated personal assistant and an arbitarge trading bot for the Algorand network. Take a look.</p>
	
	<p>I am currently on the lookout for opportunities in kdb+/q  or the cryptography/cryptocurrency space. One would be nice, both would be nicer.</p>
